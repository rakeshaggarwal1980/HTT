![alt Angular](https://angular.io/assets/images/logos/angular/angular.png)

This project is a reference and a toolbox project for **Angular 6.1.1.**  The project could be used as a reference and toolbox for new or existing internal projects.
The most used modules, component and libaries has been implemented into this project. 

The project can be viewed here: https://toolbox-reference-angular.dev.evry.site/

The project is following *John Papas Angular Styleguide*: https://angular.io/guide/styleguide

The project is using the CSS-framework **Bootsrap 4**.

The following project was mainly created using the **Angular CLI**. It is recommended to use the CLI when creating new projects and use this project more as a reference.
If you decide to clone this project and make changes, it is still recommended to use the commands integrated in the CLI, to create new components, modules, services etc.
The relevant files will then be imported, created and imported in the correct modules etc. This will help ensuring correct style and folder structure.

## Installation

Start by cloning the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/evry-bergen/reference-angular.git
```

When the project is cloned, install the npm packages:

```
npm install
```

You can now run the project, and the angular project should be visible at localhost:4200

```
npm start
```

To save 95 % build time, you can use the new Angular 5 feature

```
ng serve --aot
```

--aot will be standard when running npm start in future Angular versions.

## Elements

### Components

In this reference project there has been created a few components, mainly to describe the best pratice folder structure.
The folder structure is based on John Papa's style guide: https://angular.io/guide/styleguide. This is also the official
Angular 2 style guide. 

All components in the project has the following naming convention: 

  `component-name.component.ts|html|scss|spec.ts.` 

When creating a new component a .ts, .html .scss and .spec should always be included! 

### Services

A simple ```example.service.ts``` has been included in the project to show the usage of services and **D**ependency **I**njection (**DI**) in Angular.
It only returns a Observable that returns true value. An Observable is used to display how to handle them, using [rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) with Observables.

The service is injected in the greeter component. It should only show the greeting if the service works as expected, and 
the ```h1``` elements contains an *ngIf.

### HTTP Interceptor

A HTTP Interceptor is created as an reference. If you ever need to log based on status, or have to handle HTTP requests/response etc.
somehow. This is the way to go. 

## TSLint 

## External Modules

In the project a few external modules that we use frequently has been imported into the project, to show how to use them. 
A detailed description of each of the modules will not be given. But a link to the GitHub repository is given as a reference.

They are all implemented and used in the project.

## Testing 

End-to-end testing and Unit Testing are both supported in this project and can be used as followed:
    
    npm test // run unit tests
        
    ng e2e // run end to end tests
    
## TSLint

To ensure good syntax standard and code quality, linting has been added to the project. You can run this by using the following command:

    ng lint -format stylish
    
Do not create a Pull Requests before running this command. This makes it easier for the reviewer to review the code.

### Hook up with backend

The following project by @salilsaini868 is a good reference project on how to combine a DOTNET project with an Angular 5 project.
In the following project a swagger generation tool has been used to hook up the front end to the webapi:
